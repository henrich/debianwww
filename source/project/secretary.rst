==========================================================================
Debian Project Secretary
==========================================================================
    
As the :doc:`Debian project <index>` grew,
it became apparent that there needed to be a set of semi-formal
rules to help in conflict resolution, and as a result the
constitution was written. :doc:`constitution`
describes the organisational structure for formal decision
making in the Project. The constitution delineates who makes
decisions, and what powers are attached to each such decision
making individual or body. The office of the Project Secretary
is one of the six entities enumerated in the Debian constitution
as a decision making entity.


Any Debian developer is eligible to be considered for the post
of the Debian Project Secretary.  Any person may hold several
posts, except that the Project Secretary may not also be the
:doc:`Debian Project Leader <leader>`, or the Chair of the
:doc:`Technical Committee <tech-ctte>`.


Appointment
==========================================================================

Unlike other delegates, who are appointed by the
:doc:`Debian Project Leader <leader>`,
the next Project Secretary is appointed by the Project Leader
and the current Project Secretary. In case the current secretary
and the project leader disagree, they must ask the Developers by
way of general resolution to appoint a Secretary.

The Project Secretary's term of office is 1 year, at which point
they or another Secretary must be (re)appointed.


Tasks performed by the Project Secretary
==========================================================================
    
* Conducting votes

  The most visible task performed by the secretary is conducting
  <a href="$(HOME)/vote/">votes</a> for the project
  -- notably the Project Leader elections, but also any other
  votes that are run (General Resolutions, for example). Running a
  vote also entails determining the number and identity of the
  people eligible to vote, for the purpose of calculating quorum.


* Standing in for other Officers

  The Project Secretary can stand in for the Leader, together with
  the Chair of the Technical Committee. In this situation, they
  may jointly make decisions if they consider it imperative to do
  so -- but only when absolutely necessary and only when
  consistent with the consensus of the Developers.

  If there is no Project Secretary or the current Secretary is
  unavailable and has not delegated authority for a decision then
  the decision may be made or delegated by the Chair of the
  Technical Committee, as Acting Secretary.


* Interpreting the Constitution

  The secretary is also responsible for adjudicating any disputes
  about interpretation of the constitution.

About Our Current Secretary
==========================================================================

The current Project Secretary is `Kurt Roeckx <kroeckx@debian.org>`_.
Kurt has been involved with free software and linux since 1995, and has
been a Debian Developer since
`August 2005 <https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/08/msg00283.html>`_.

Kurt has a Masters degree in Electronics and ICT, awarded by Hogeschool
voor Wetenschap &amp; Kunst.

Kurt has been Project Secretary since February 2009; he took up the
position after the previous secretary, Manoj Srivastava, resigned from
the position. Apart from being Project Secretary, Kurt is an AMD64 porter
and maintains `12 packages <https://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=kurt@roeckx.be>`_ 
including libtool, ntp and openssl.


The assistant secretary post
==========================================================================

Due to the increasing amount of work (i.e.: votes) that the secretary was
starting to need to handle, the DPL (at the time, Steve McIntyre) and the
previous secretary (Manoj) decided that it would be a good idea to
appoint an assistant in cases of unavailability.

Currently, `Neil McGovern <neilm@debian.org>`_ serves in this position.
