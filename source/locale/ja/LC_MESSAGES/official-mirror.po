msgid "To become an official mirror, it should meet the following criteria:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/official-mirror.rst:19
msgid ""
"The site should be reliable and be up 24 hours a day. The machine should "
"not be heavily loaded."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/official-mirror.rst:21
msgid "The **whole** Debian archive should be mirrored."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/official-mirror.rst:22

"Disk space commitments (with room for expansion) &mdash; see the :doc"
":`mirror-size`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/official-mirror.rst:24
msgid "The mirror should be updated with :ref:`ftpsync script <ftpsync>`."

#: ../../source/official-mirror.rst:25

":doc:`push-mirroring` needs to be set up; feel free to contact us to get "
"in touch with the maintainer of another mirror."

#: ../../source/official-mirror.rst:27
msgid ""
"It should have a decent connectivity (relative to the respective "
"country). Bandwidth equivalent to a 100Mbps connection or better is "
"preferred; note that for developed countries, this minimum is much "
"higher."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/official-mirror.rst:30
msgid ""
"The routers in front of the server shouldn't have any global access bans "
"or major limitations of bandwidth."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/official-mirror.rst:32
msgid ""
"The server needs to be able to sustain the traffic, i.e. have reasonable "
"limits on the HTTP, FTP and rsync daemons, including tuning the maximum "
"number of connections in general and the maximum number of connections "
"from a single IP."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/official-mirror.rst:36
msgid ""
"The mirror hierarchy should be available under <kbd>/debian</kbd>. "
"Rationale: for consistency between sites &mdash; you may simply place a "
"symlink if you want to keep the mirror somewhere else, or set up a "
"virtual host."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/official-mirror.rst:40
msgid "The mirror should be made available at least via these protocols:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/official-mirror.rst:42
msgid "HTTP (http://your.server/debian/)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/official-mirror.rst:44
msgid ""
"HTTP is used because with HTTP/1.1 transfers have the potential of being "
"more efficient than with FTP."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/official-mirror.rst:47
msgid "FTP (ftp://your.server/debian/)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/official-mirror.rst:49
msgid "FTP is the most senior protocol, and still very widely used."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/official-mirror.rst:53

"Rsync is the preferred method of mirroring, and one of the main functions"
" of an official mirror is to help the proliferation of secondary mirrors."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/official-mirror.rst:57
msgid ""
"The mirror should be registered as public mirror (using our :doc:`submit "
"mirror information form <submit-mirror>`)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/official-mirror.rst:61
msgid ""
"Please note that these are just guidelines, but we will be more likely to"
" accept your site as an official mirror if the above conditions are met. "
"It is also generally desirable for the site to have a history of working "
"as described above."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/official-mirror.rst:66

"All applications for official sites, including exact information on "
"bandwidth consumption and any limits, should be sent to "

"Debian depends on information provided by users and mirror maintainers in"
" order to make decisions about the mirror hierarchy. All constructive "
"input regarding existing or missing official mirrors is welcome at "

"<https://lists.debian.org/debian-mirrors/>`_."

"If there isn't already an ftp.<var>&lt;country&gt;</var>.debian.org for "
"your country, any mirror maintainer can apply for their site to become "
"the official one, provided it meets the criteria outlined below."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/official-mirror.rst:84
msgid ""
"In countries where there is already an official mirror assigned, it is "
"still possible to set up more official sites, but only if there is demand"
" for such a thing. In large countries, like the US, and countries with "
"more than one major backbone that aren't well connected, like Australia, "
"it is even a good idea."

"Usually, the first site will be given the aliases "
"ftp.&lt;country&gt;.debian.org and ftp1.&lt;country&gt;.debian.org. "
"Future sites will simply be given an alias of the second type with the "
"number incremented appropriately."
