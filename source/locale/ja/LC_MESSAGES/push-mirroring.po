"Push mirroring is a form of mirroring that minimizes the time it takes "
"for changes to the archive to reach mirrors. The master server uses a "
"triggering mechanism to immediately inform the client mirror that it "
"needs to be updated."

"It takes a little more effort to set up since the maintainers of the "
"upstream and downstream mirror must exchange information. The benefit is "
"that the upstream mirror initiates the mirror process immediately after "
"its archive has been updated. This allows changes to the archive to "
"propagate extremely quickly."

"First some background on ssh. Ssh allows people to connect to accounts on"
" different machines in a secure way. Not only are passwords never passed "
"in the clear, once you connect to a machine you are basically guaranteed "
"that future connections will be to the same machine. This prevents many "
"man-in-the-middle attacks."

"One capability ssh has is the ability for a user to take the public "
"identity key for a user on another machine and add it to a file of "
"authorized keys on your machine. By default, the user on the other "
"machine (who has the private identity key associated with the public "
"identity key given to you) then has login privileges to your account. It "
"is possible, though, to add text to an authorized key restricting the "
"type of access a person accessing your account using that key has."

"So to protect the downstream mirror, the key provided by the upstream "
"mirror has text added to it to limit it to only give the person accessing"
" your account permission to do one thing &mdash; start the program on "
"your machine that updates your mirror. Even if someone (an evil third "
"party) was able to break the key, the most they could do is to start the "
"mirror program on your machine. You do not even have to worry about "
"multiple copies of the program being started as a lockfile is used."

"On the upstream end, rsync can be configured to restrict who can mirror a"
" given area by username and password. These are totally separate from "
":file:`/etc/passwd` so a push server doesn't have to worry about giving "
"others access to their machine. As it is set up, the username and "
"password are passed in the clear. This shouldn't be a problem though, as "
"the worst that can happen is that a third party gains the ability to "
"mirror Debian from that site."
