use. As a part of this process, the Debian trademark is a registered United
States trademark of `Software in the Public Interest, Inc. <http://www.spi-inc.org/corporate/trademarks/>`_,

Trademark Policy
============================================================================

.. codeblocks::

Version: 2.0
Published: 19 January 2013

`Software in the Public Interest, Inc. <http://www.spi-inc.org/>`_
owns a number of trademarks in both word and logo form including brands,
slogans, styles. This policy encompasses all marks, in word and logo form,
collectively referred to as "Debian trademarks". You can see a
non-exhaustive list of Debian trademarks, including both registered and
unregistered (but otherwise legally recognized) trademarks at our
:ref:`trademarks page <trademarks>`.

The objective of this trademark policy is:

 #. to encourage widespread use and adoption of the Debian trademarks,
 #. to clarify proper usage of Debian trademarks by third parties,
 #. to prevent misuse of Debian trademarks that can confuse or mislead users
    with respect to Debian or its affiliates.

Please note that it is not the goal of this policy to limit commercial
activity around Debian. We encourage businesses to work on Debian while being
compliant with this policy.

Following are the guidelines for the proper use of Debian trademarks by
publishers and other third parties. Any use of or reference to Debian
trademarks that is inconsistent with these guidelines, or other unauthorized
use of or reference to Debian trademarks, or use of marks that are confusingly
similar to Debian trademarks, is prohibited and may violate Debian trademark
rights.

Any use of Debian trademarks in a misleading and false manner or in a manner
that disparages Debian, such as untruthful advertising, is always
prohibited.


When You Can Use the Debian Trademarks Without Asking Permission
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 #. You can use Debian trademarks to make true factual statements about
    Debian or communicate compatibility with your product truthfully.

 #. Your intended use qualifies as "nominative fair use" of the Debian
    trademarks, i.e., merely identifying that you are talking about Debian in a
    text, without suggesting sponsorship or endorsement.

 #. You can use Debian trademarks to describe or advertise your services
    or products relating to Debian in a way that is not misleading.

 #. You can use Debian trademarks to describe Debian in articles, titles
    or blog posts.

 #. You can make t-shirts, desktop wallpapers, caps, or other merchandise
    with Debian trademarks for *non-commercial usage*.

 #. You can also make merchandise with Debian trademarks
    for *commercial usage*. In case of commercial usage, we recommend
    that you truthfully advertise to customers which part of the selling
    price, if any, will be donated to the Debian project. See
    our :ref:`donations page <donations>` for more information
    on how to donate to the Debian project.


When You Can NEVER Use the Debian Trademarks Without Asking Permission
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 #. You cannot use Debian trademarks in any way that suggests an
    affiliation with or endorsement by the Debian project or community, if the
    same is not true.

    as the name of a product or service.

 #. You cannot use a name that is confusingly similar to Debian
    trademarks.

 #. You cannot use Debian trademarks in a domain name, with or without
    commercial intent.


How to Use the Debian Trademarks
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

    project is related to the Debian project, but that it is not part of
    Debian, produced by the Debian project, or endorsed by the Debian
    project.

 #. Acknowledge Software in the Public Interest, Inc.'s ownership of the
    Debian trademark prominently.

    *Example:*

    [TRADEMARK] is a ("registered", if applicable) trademark owned by
    Software in the Public Interest, Inc.
  
 #. Include a disclaimer of sponsorship, affiliation, or endorsement by
    Debian on your website and on all related printed materials.

    *Example:*

    X PROJECT is not affiliated with Debian. Debian is a registered
    trademark owned by Software in the Public Interest, Inc. 

 #. Distinguish the Debian trademarks from the surrounding words by
    italicizing, bolding or underlining it.

 #. Use the Debian trademarks in their exact form, neither abbreviated or
    hyphenated, nor combined with any other word or words.

 #. Do not create acronyms using the Debian trademarks.

Guidelines for Using Logos

    or branding itself. They can be used as part of a page describing your
    products or services.
