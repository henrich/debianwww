Debian for IA-64
===============================================================

Status
===============================================================
**discontined**

IA-64 has been a supported Debian architecture since Debian 3.0 (woody)


BIOS Versions
===============================================================
All modern ia64 systems should work fine.

It's possible that you may find a very early ia64 machine that needs
a BIOS upgrade to work well with Linux. One particular combination 
we've heard about is trying to run new kernels on "Lion" systems
with really old BIOS versions.  

To try to make this easier, here's what we know about BIOS versions
that work well for Debian on older ia64 systems:

 * Lion (aka HP rx4610) version 99b works well.
 * BigSur (aka HP i2000) version 130 works well.

Firmware downloads for <a href="http://www.hp.com">HP</a>
systems are available starting

If anyone has information about suitable BIOS versions for other IA-64 systems
that are successfully running Debian, let us know on the debian-ia64 list!

Contacts
===============================================================
The instigators of the IA-64 port were Bdale Garbee and Randolph Chung.
The best way to ask questions is via
the `debian-ia64 mailing list <https://lists.debian.org/debian-ia64/>`_.
